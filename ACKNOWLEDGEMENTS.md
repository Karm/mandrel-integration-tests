## MicroProfile Starter
Test application ```quarkus-full-microprofile``` is a modified version of code 
originally generated by [https://start.microprofile.io/](https://start.microprofile.io/). 
Some utility methods were adopted from [https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-starter/](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-starter/) 
and modified to suit the purpose of this test suite (TS). The adapted work was authored

## Micronaut
Micronaut Hello World application was adapted from a generated quickstart project on [https://micronaut.io/launch/](https://micronaut.io/launch/) 
and from the Micronaut's cli tool generated `mn create-app hello-world --build maven` project.

## Helidon
Helidon example app was adapted from a Helidon SE QuickStart archetype. See [QuickStart](https://helidon.io/docs/latest/#/se/guides/02_quickstart).

## Windows console and CTRL+C
The method of handling the CTRL+C was adopted by Michal Karm Babacek <karm@redhat.com> from hints by [Stanislav](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15281070/32453) and [rogerdpack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/813086/can-i-send-a-ctrl-c-sigint-to-an-application-on-windows#comment50066881_15281070).
